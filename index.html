<header><h2>About</h2></header>
<br /><br />

<p>I started drawing before I could speak, and have not been able to stop since. 
My work in traditional art is primarily mixed media. I make use of dip pens,
oil paint, acrylics, watercolor paint, crayons, paper cutouts and found objects. 
I've had my paintings and sculptures featured in galleries throughout the US.</p> 

<p> I have worked in graphic design and web design since 2003 and continually strive
to learn new technologies. I specialize in creating web sites, logotypes 
and logos that truly reflect the people and organizations they are made for.</p>

<p>I first started using <abbr title="Linux and Unix">*nix</abbr> based operating systems in 1998. I wanted an alternative to the other operating systems in use at the time, and made the jump 
after seeing a freebsd box. My love of free open source software and commandline
tools has only grown since then.</p>

<header><h2>Affilliations</h2></header>
<br /><br />

<p>I frequently volunteer my time with free open source software projects and
non-profit organizations. I have listed a few of those below.</p>

<h3>Arch Linux</h3>

<p>Site: <a href="https://archlinux.org">https://archlinux.org</a></p> 

<p>Arch Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution with a fantastic community and
great documentation. I try to help out where I can by adding to documentation,
walking new users through installations, creating packages and building up the
community.</p>

<h3>Arch Linux Women</h3>

<p>Site: <a href="http://archowmen.org">http://archwomen.org</a></p>

<p>I founded Arch Linux Women in Febuary of 2012 to network with other 
female Arch users and encourage more women to use and contribute to Arch Linux.
The experiance so far has been fantastic and I've gotten to know some amazing 
people through this project.</p> 

<h3>Wikimedia Foundation</h3>

<p>Site: <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a></p>
<p>
I contribute to many of Wikimedia's projects, including wikidictionary,
wikipedia, mediawiki and wikibooks. I edit articles, upload images, vote in
referendums and contribute to their yearly fund raising efforts.
