<header>Can I haz title pls?</header>

<p>This is some place holder text for the site. You should stop and read all of it because its super interesting and totally not a waste of your time. The colors were made to wreck havok with your retina's. pls stare at the high contrast text MOAR</p>

<p>Oh wait, don't go! I'm not done yet! Check THIS out: <em>slanty text</em>. Is cool right? Yeah, I knew you would like that you silly <acronym title="Not Even Remotely Dorky">nerd</acronym>. Ok, I have an idea, lets play a game! Yes, a simple text game. You get to read the rest of this document and figure out how many different text types there are! Sounds like fun? OK lets <b>go!</b> Did you catch that bold text there? If not, thats the last time I'm giving you a hint. Find the rest yourself. Now its time for something different:</p>

<p>At this point I'm going to assume you decided to cheat at our little game, and look at the source code of this page to see all the text formatting used. Well guess what? I'm not going to tell you the answer. Because you are a cheater. CHEATER! And even if you haven't cheated yet, now that the idea is there, you are going to.</p>
